"""Red-team attacker + HTTP trigger, combined into one Cloud Run service.

The GCP MCP connector available in this session only manages Cloud Run
*Services* (list/get/deploy), not Jobs, so the batch-Job design from
deploy/job/ doesn't fit this deploy path. Folding the trigger and the
campaign runner into one service is the natural adaptation: POST /run
*is* the HTTPS trigger, and it runs the campaign synchronously (a 12-seed
campaign finishes in well under Cloud Run's request timeout) and returns
the full result -- findings, HTML report, and patch proposals -- in one
response, so there's no separate execution-polling step needed for this
quick-test path.

POST /run?stream=1 opts into a second response mode: instead of one
buffered JSON body at the end, the response streams a newline-delimited
JSON ("NDJSON") line the moment each action happens -- which seed/category/
turn is running, the attacker's exact mutated prompt, the target's
response, the judge's verdict -- so `curl -N ... "/run?stream=1"` shows the
campaign unfold live in the terminal instead of going quiet for the whole
duration. The very last line is the same full result object the
non-streaming mode returns as its only body (tagged "event": "result"), so
existing tooling that just wants the final JSON can always take the last
line. Every one of these events is also written to Cloud Logging as a
structured line regardless of whether streaming was requested (see
`aegis_redteam/orchestrator.py` / `gcp_logging.py`), so Logs Explorer shows
the same live detail for triggers that didn't ask for a streamed response
(e.g. a scheduled/cron trigger with no one watching a terminal).

        #      chunked transfer-encoding isn't a legal thing to declare on
        #      an HTTP/1.0 response at all, so GFE rejected it outright.
        #   2. Dropped Transfer-Encoding entirely and relied on "body ends
        #      when the connection closes" (with protocol_version bumped to
        #      "HTTP/1.1" and "Connection: close" sent) -- legal per RFC
        #      7230 3.3.3 #7, but GFE still rejected it: its pass-through
        #      pipeline apparently needs an explicit length or explicit
        #      chunked framing, not a close-delimited body.
        #   3. Real HTTP/1.1 chunked Transfer-Encoding *and*
        #      protocol_version = "HTTP/1.1" together -- the combination
        #      attempt 1 never actually tried, since it was still declaring
        #      chunked framing while defaulting to HTTP/1.0. Each chunk is
        #      "<hex length>\r\n<chunk bytes>\r\n", terminated by the
        #      standard zero-length final chunk "0\r\n\r\n". Verified byte-
        #      correct locally (curl decodes it with zero artifacts) --
        #      STILL a 403 from GFE against the real Cloud Run deployment.
        #
        # That means response framing was never the actual variable -- three
        # very different, individually-correct framings can't all coincidentally
        # trigger the identical error. Two things stayed constant across every
        # attempt instead: the "?stream=1" query string on the URL, and the
        # "application/x-ndjson" Content-Type (not a common/allowlisted MIME
