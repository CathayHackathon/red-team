"""Structured logging for Cloud Logging.

Cloud Run (and GKE) automatically capture container stdout/stderr as log
entries. If a line is valid JSON with top-level "severity" and "message"
keys, Cloud Logging treats it as a *structured* entry: "severity" becomes
the entry's log level and every other key lands in `jsonPayload`, filterable
in Logs Explorer — e.g. `jsonPayload.run_id="abc123"` or
`jsonPayload.event="finding_confirmed" AND jsonPayload.attack_severity>=3`.

That's the entire mechanism used here: no `google-cloud-logging` client
library, no extra IAM role (`roles/logging.logWriter` is what Cloud Run's
own runtime service account already needs, not this code), no network call.
Every track the harness records — each attack turn, each judge verdict,
each patch proposal, each patch application — is a JSON line to stdout, and
Cloud Logging ingests it for free. Locally, the same lines just print as
JSON in the terminal.

This is deliberately separate from `store.py` (Firestore/JSONL): the store
is the queryable "current findings" table the report reads; Cloud Logging
is the immutable, timestamped audit trail across every run, and the
substrate for log-based alerting (e.g. a log-based metric counting
`attack_severity>=4` entries, alerting the moment one appears).
