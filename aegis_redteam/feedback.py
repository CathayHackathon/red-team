"""Closes the loop: turns confirmed high-severity findings into guardrail
patch proposals that AegisOps's self-improvement process can ingest.

This is the piece that makes the red-team system part of the *self-improving*
platform rather than a bolt-on scanner: every campaign either confirms the
current guardrails hold, or produces a concrete, reviewable patch plus the
regression seed that proves whether the patch worked.
